As defined in requirement:" Relevance is defined as frequency of the company name 
appearing in the article divided by the number of words in the article."
In our case, Verizon Wireless count as one company thus result in one word as hit count.
Technically Verizon Wireless is one name or two words, since it's not specified in
requirement, we regard it as one name and one hit count.
