As stated in the requirement:
"Punctuation and other symbols should not impact the search. 
So the appearance of Microsoft Corporation, Inc. in the companies.dat file should 
match with Microsoft Corporation Inc in the article."
Later in the file it shows:
"Apple Inc.	4	3.08333%"
Where the "." is not ignored as said previously.
In our case, we use "Apple Inc." as a whole word to bypass this conflict.
